* BUGS
** DONE Defining as dynamic an already lexical var: org-capture-templates
For some reason, I have to turn of the lexical variable.

* TODO
** DONE Make a initialization function that makes all files exist.
I have to remake the function, it has a logic error in it.
** DONE Make a function that uses org-capture-templates to add a task to the files.
** DONE Make a custom tag for the files
If I don't do that, conflicts will arise.

It now uses [#1] and things like that. Numbers instead of letters.
** DONE Easy Movement between files
This is done with 'org-revise-goto'
** DONE Make a function that edits the date when a task is done
** Add a warning for people who use Integers as org priorities.
** Methord to integrate with original org-capture-templates
** Easy Refiling
** Autoload
