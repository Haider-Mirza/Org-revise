* TODO
** DONE Make a initialization function that makes all files exist.
I have to remake the function, it has a logic error in it.
** DONE Make a function that uses org-capture-templates to add a task to the files.
** PRIORITY Make a custom tag for the files
If I don't do that, conflicts will arise.
** Extend org-revise-create with variables
*** Work out how to use defcustom
I have learnt how to use the majority of defcustom but I am still new to it. The package is quite configurable now.
** Easy Refiling
** Easy Movement between files
** Autoload
** Methord to integrate with original org-capture-templates
